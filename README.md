# An Analysis of Diamond Prices

## Overview

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of diamond prices using various statistical and machine learning techniques, structured in R Markdown, integrating code and documentation. The primary focus is on exploratory data analysis, data visualization, and predictive modeling.

## Setup

The project uses R as the programming language with an initial setup chunk that includes library imports. Libraries such as `tidyverse`, `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, and others are used for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

## Data Importing

The dataset "diamonds.csv" is loaded into a variable named data. Initial exploration involves viewing the first few rows of the dataset to understand the structure and contents.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Structure and Dimension**: The script uses functions like `str` to understand the dataset's structure, including variable names, data types, and counts.
- **Missing Values**: The script checks for missing values and ensures data quality before proceeding with further analysis.
- **Duplicates Check**: Ensures there are no duplicate observations that might skew the analysis.

## Visualization and Statistical Analysis

1. **Distribution of Variables**: Histograms and bar plots for each variable to understand distributions.
2. **Price vs. Other Variables**: Analyzes the relationship between price and other variables using various plots.
3. **Correlation Analysis**: A correlation matrix is generated to understand the interdependence between variables.
4. **Statistical Tests**: Performs Z-tests and T-tests on ratio-type variables to understand their statistical properties.

## Modelling

- **Linear Regression**: Establishes a baseline model with multiple linear regression, checking assumptions and fitting the model.
- **Lasso, Ridge, Elastic-Net**: These models are used for regularization and feature selection, with an emphasis on their tuning and interpretation.
- **Model Comparison**: Compares the performance of different models based on various metrics like RMSE, MAE, and others.

## Results and Discussion

The project concludes with the best model's findings and interpretations. It involves plotting predicted vs. actual prices and understanding the model's effectiveness.

## Notes

- The project is dynamic, with dates auto-updated to reflect the current date.
- For ridge regression and other models, data normalization is considered to ensure fair penalization.
- The document is interactive and allows for live execution of R code within the Markdown environment.

## Conclusion

This project represents a thorough approach to understanding and predicting diamond prices. It employs various statistical techniques and predictive modeling, ensuring a deep dive into the dataset and providing robust insights.
